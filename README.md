1. you need these two datasets to run the code [malimg_dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11hFATp6dMv1cmc2vEzGnrmWc8u35-mme?usp=sharing) and [trojan_classes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B7dKd96OLKFeJPOHq6GThTNRNUKPnvuK?usp=sharing).
2. then upload these two datasets in your drive
3. run the combined.ipynb , which consists of classification, detection, finding performance metrics along with ROC curve.
